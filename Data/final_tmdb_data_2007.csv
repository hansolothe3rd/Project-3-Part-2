The film's three primary stories each represents a different point in the cycles of courtship and childbirth. One young woman hopes to elope with her unseen fiance, but faces insurmountable problems when he doesn't show up. An older, married woman seeks to buy a pregnancy test, the results of which could dictate her marriage's fate.

As a parallel to the main plot, sequences of a mysterious travelling circus keep reappearing in a very suggestive way. Many of the odd artists at the circus are people that the four protagonists encounter in the wilderness along the overgrown railway.  All through the movie there is a sensation of magic crossed with pure realism, stressed by the crackling communistic infrastructure and a twisted sense of humor.

Now he plays pachinko everyday with his live-in girlfriend, Junko. He has a habit of ""huffing"" paint thinner. His debts accumulate every day. Hisashi's old friend from the gang, Ozawa is a loan shark. He persuades Hisashi to join his easy-money-making scheme, ""Quit inhaling paint thinner and score big with me!""

In this ordinary place that is just like hundreds of other small towns in Japan, Hisashi sees the darkness. Darkness that is out of the reach of neon lights along the highway. In the vacuum of this darkness, life repeats itself endlessly. Hisashi has a flashback of a paint-thinner trip he once had. The hallucination tempts him to the other side. Tantalized, he asks himself, ""Can I really go?",0.6000000000000001,/sLjBKW83zkYwly8G2F1xUFAlw87.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'JP', 'name': 'Japan'}]",2007-01-01,0.0,77.0,"[{'english_name': 'Japanese', 'iso_639_1': 'ja', 'name': '日本語'}]",Released,,The Route 20 National Road,0.0,5.0,3.0,
