At summer's end, when she is 17, Mariette Baptiste, educated daughter of the local doctor, enters the cloistered convent of Our Lady of the Afflictions as a postulant. Her religious fervor, understated but determined, makes an impact on the small community of nuns whose days and nights are measured in a round of prayer and farm work changing only with the seasons. Their ordered life is disrupted, however, as Mariette begins to fall into a series of trances from which she awakens with stigmata, which heal as spontaneously as they appear. The feelings of skepticism, jealousy and adoration evoked in the nuns, Mariette's own response and that of the Mother Superior are delicately, indelibly presented.",0.934,,"[{'id': 11308, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Savoy Pictures', 'origin_country': ''}, {'id': 23808, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Price Entertainment', 'origin_country': ''}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",1996-07-04,0.0,86.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,Mariette in Ecstasy,0.0,0.0,0.0,PG-13

With tough friends like Hei-di, his girlfriend Ah-hua who prostitutes herself, and Qingmao who has just returned from prison, Leizi spends his time drinking and keeping the neighbourhood awake. They extort money from Ah-hua's clients and sell things for the local gangster, Mr. Lian. When Leizi meets the righteous daughter of the Christian foreman, he starts having his doubts about his lifestyle.
